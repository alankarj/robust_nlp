========================================================================
The new NLI Test Set

Version 1.0, February 2018
========================================================================

== Overview ==

This dataset consists of 8193 premise-hypothesis sentence-pairs annotated to entailment, contradiction, and neutral. The premise and the hypothesis are identical except for one word/phrase that was replaced. This dataset is meant for testing methods trained to solve the natural language inference task, and it requires some lexical and world knowledge to achieve reasonable performance on it.

== Fields ==

sentence1: The premise sentence.

sentence2: The hypothesis sentence, which is the same as the premise except for one word/phrase that was replaced.

annotator_labels: These are all of the individual labels from the three annotators. 

gold_label: This is the label chosen by the majority of annotators. 

pairID: A unique identifier for each sentence1--sentence2 pair.

category: This category sematically groups the replaced words.


== Data Source ==

The premise sentences are taken from the Stanford Natural Language Inference corpus:

	Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. 2015.
	A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference. 
	Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).
